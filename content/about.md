Recently I found out that some of the things I have experienced, learned, and done can be applicable for others in navigating their professional lives. I have found that there’s a lot of know-how that is fairly easy to distill and pass on - even though it takes a lot of courage and hard work for the mentee to implement it. I was very lucky to have met one of my most inspiring, supportive mentors early on in my 20s’ - and I believe every person deserves someone like that.

This blog is my attempt at a more systematic approach to career mentoring, and I think it may be interesting to a wider audience - beyond juniors starting their careers in web and software development. These are essentially the recordings of things I wish I had known when I was starting my journey.

## About The Author

I'm a recovering copy-paster. Got traumatized by [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) while studying Cognitive Science, went out into the world and… moved to [Jawa Timur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Java). I had all sorts of life adventures in teaching, communication, and peopling - among others. After spending some time doing sales I decided to try building things instead. I did a full stack development bootcamp, was shown [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) and got hooked.

These days I enjoy anything that comes with a CLI and eradicates the need for pressing ctrl+c. I work in [Site Reliability Engineering](https://linkedin.com/in/dariagru) and I'm connecting tech ladies in the Czech Republic through [CyberMagnolia — Women's Tech Collective](http://cybermagnolia.com/).

Ideal holiday in my world means [4-6B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_scale) on [Kattegat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kattegat) or smashing headfirst into snow on a board. I'm trying to achieve perfection at preparing scrambled eggs and oatmeal. I run on coffee and pancakes.

Thank you for stopping by the blog. I hope you'll enjoy the readings.
