I'm a recovering copy-paster. Got traumatized by [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) while studying Cognitive Science, went out into the world andâ€¦ moved to [Jawa Timur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Java). I had all sorts of life adventures in teaching, communication, and peopling - among others. After spending some time doing sales I decided to try building things instead. I did a full stack development bootcamp, was shown [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) and got hooked.

These days I enjoy anything that comes with a CLI and eradicates the need for pressing ctrl+c. I work in [Site Reliability Engineering](https://linkedin.com/in/dariagru) and the thrill of incident management reminds me of sailing. I try to drive [Hive Talks meetups](https://www.meetup.com/apiaryio/events/) and help organize [PyConCZ](https://cz.pycon.org/2020/).

Ideal holiday in my world means [4-6B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_scale) on [Kattegat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kattegat) or smashing headfirst into snow on a board. I'm trying to achieve perfection at preparing scrumbled eggs and oatmeal. I run on coffee and pancakes.
