## tl;dr - Here’s my list if you prefer to skip the story:

1. Pick a single commander and follow his lead, not that of random bystanders.
2. Allow the commander time to think things through, keep silent while they do that.
3. Choose a single plan and have the whole team commit to it.
4. Keep an eye on others, but don’t push your help when they don’t want it.
5. Use strict communication protocols to ensure correct information flow.
6. Debrief and have a retrospective and a lessons-learned session with the team shortly afterwards.
7. Celebrate the adventure.
